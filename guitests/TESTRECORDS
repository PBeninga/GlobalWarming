LOGIN
To begin with, we checked if logins worked. We tried to login with a username and password
not stored in our database, "jrjiow" and "rfwweq". That resulted in a message appearing saying
user not found. Empty strings resulted in the same message appearing. We then created an account
called "Bro" with the password of "Bro". This lead the client to start the game.

CREATE ACCOUNT
We began with creating an account with a username that already exists. This lead to our game
displaying a message that the account already exists. We then attempted to create an account
that does not exist. This leads to the successful creation of the account, which his signified by
the start of the game. We then exited the game and attempted to log back in with this newly created
account. The login was successful.

ARMY DISPLAY
This was a simple test to see if the army display would cycle and be used correctly. The army display,
when clicked on, successfully cycles through the available sprites. When the game starts, the sprite
chosen remains as your sprite for all members of that game.


SOUNDS
We checked to make sure that the sound changes between the main menu and the game, that buttons boop when
pressed, that battles properly sound out, that marching successfully sounds, and that the sound can be
increased and decreased. All of these tests worked as expected.

SWIPES
We attempted to create several incorrect swipes in different ways. We attempted to swipe an army that was not
ours, we attempted to swipe an army onto a path it shouldn't have been able to go down, we attempted to swipe
armies into esoteric paths(from a node to another node back to the original node, and so on and so forth),
we attempted to swipe an army, then not complete the swipe. All tests performed as expected. These are the main
interactions the player can make, so we tested them thoroughly to be sure that they work properly.
